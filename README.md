This project utilizes React Router for handling routing between different pages. The application is structured with several components, each corresponding to a route.

BrowserRouter: Wraps the entire application to enable routing functionality.
Routes: Contains all the defined routes.
Route: Specifies the path and the component to be displayed for that path.


Available Routes:
/: Renders the Home component.
/about: Renders the AboutUs component.
/contact: Renders the Contact component.

This setup allows seamless navigation between pages without full page reloads, providing a smooth user experience.
